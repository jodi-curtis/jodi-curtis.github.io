      <p id="about-intro">
        Jazz music originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the late 19th and 
        early 20th centuries, with its roots in blues and ragtime. Brass bands, gospel choirs, and blues musicians 
        converged to create a new and electrifying sound. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a 
        major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue 
        notes, complex chords, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in European 
        harmony and African rhythmic rituals. As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and 
        local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles.

            The 1920s saw the emergence of the "Jazz Age," a period of cultural and artistic flourishing marked by 
            the widespread popularity of jazz music. Hot jazz, characterized by its lively rhythms and improvisational 
            spirit, became the dominant style of the era.

        <dt>1930s-1940s: Swing Era and Bebop Revolution</dt>
        <dd>
          In the 1930s and '40s, jazz entered the swing era, characterized by big bands and danceable rhythms. In the 
          1930s, arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz (a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational 
          style), and gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged 
          in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging "musician's music". It 
          pushed the boundaries of jazz in new and exciting directions with it's faster tempos, complex harmonies 
          and intricate improvisations. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother 
          sounds and long, linear melodic lines.

            The 1950s and '60s saw the rise of cool jazz and hard bop, two contrasting styles that reflected the 
            diverse tastes of the era. Cool jazz favored a laid-back and understated approach, with an emphasis 
            on melodic improvisation and sophisticated harmonies and even began to incorporate elements of 
            classical music. In contrast, hard bop embraced a more energetic and earthy sound with a heavy gospel 
            influence and incorporation of African and Latin rhythms. A strong connection to the blues can be heard 
            in its mostly minor key. Modal jazz also emerged in the late 1950's, using the mode, or musical scale 
            as the basis of musical structure and improvisation.

        <dt>1970s-Present: Fusion, Contemporary Jazz, and Beyond</dt>
        <dd>
          From the 1970s onwards, jazz continued to evolve and diversify, incorporating elements of Latin music, 
          funk, rock, and avant-garde experimentation. Fusion, a genre that blended jazz with elements of rock, 
          funk, and electronic music, became increasingly popular and in the early 1980s, a commercial form of 
          jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Contemporary jazz 
          artists continued to explore new directions in improvisation, composition, and collaboration. Today, 
          jazz remains a vibrant and influential genre, with a global community of musicians and enthusiasts 
          dedicated to preserving its legacy and pushing its boundaries. From intimate jazz clubs to world-renowned 
          festivals, jazz music continues to captivate audiences with its infectious rhythms, soulful melodies, 
          and boundless spirit of improvisation.
