        <h2>Miles Davis</h2>
        <h3>1926 - 1991</h3>
        <div class="artist-info">
          <img class="artist-img" src="images/miles.jpg" alt="Miles Davis"> 
          <p>
            One of the most important and influential jazz musicians of all time, Miles Davis was a relentless innovator 
            who was a key player in numerous stylistic developments in jazz. He featured on classic bebop sessions with 
            Charlie Parker in the mid-1940s, fronted the nine-piece Birth of the Cool band, made some of the best hard 
            bop records of the 1950s with his First Great Quintet and pioneered modal jazz on Milestones and Kind of Blue.
            His Second Great Quintet experimented with freer forms in the '60s, while In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew 
            ushered in the jazz-rock and fusion era. As a jazz instrumentalist, Davis is noted for his use of space and 
            cool use of the trumpet's mid register, although some of his post-'50s work reveals a wilder side. While other 
            jazz trumpeters could play higher and faster than Miles, his ability to put together fabulous bands and 
            create classic albums is virtually unmatched. Regularly named as the best jazz album ever, Kind of Blue 
            features Miles at his cool, considered best.

        <h2>Louis Armstrong</h2>
        <h3>1901 - 1971</h3>
        <div class="artist-info">
          <p>
            After growing up in extreme poverty in New Orleans, jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong broke down racial 
            barriers and became a hugely famous mainstream celebrity at a time when this was unusual for African 
            Americans. He was arguably the first major jazz star, and - with his rhythmically sophisticated, 
            operatic style - remains the greatest jazz musician of all time according to many. Armstrong helped 
            popularise scat singing, and his gravelly voice was later heard on pop hits like ' What a Wonderful 
            World'. But, at least amongst jazz musicians, he is most remembered for his brilliant trumpet playing; 
            particularly for the 1920s recordings with his Hot 5s and Hot 7s, which helped to change jazz's focus 
            from collective improvisation to individual soloists.

        <h2>John Coltrane</h2>
        <h3>1926 - 1967</h3>
        <div class="artist-info">
          <img class="artist-img" src="images/john.jpg" alt="John Coltrane">
          <p>
            Saxophonist John Coltrane was a relentless practiser who never stopped searching and striving to 
            develop as a jazz artist. A relatively late bloomer amongst his fellow saxophone players, he did 
            not make his first album as a leader until he was 30 years old. He initially made his mark with 
            mid-'50s hard bop, as a member of Miles Davis' First Great Quintet and on his own records like 
            Blue Train. In the mid-1950s and early '60s his own compositions - 'Giant Steps', 'Countdown' 
            and '26-2' - explored new harmonic territory, with highly challenging harmonic sequences based 
            on key centres moving quickly in thirds. The legendary jazz artist was also present for the 
            birth of modal jazz, appearing on Davis' seminal Kind of Blue. As a saxophonist, 'Trane is noted 
            for his metallic, snaking tone, and his unique 'sheets of sound' approach. His 1960s quartet is 
            considered one of the all-time great jazz groups, while his work in his final years embraced 
            the new free jazz movement and took on a deeply spiritual direction. Coltrane's 1964 masterpiece 
            A Love Supreme features his classic quartet - with McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison and Elvin Jones 
            in the rhythm section - on an intense suite of religion-inspired modal jazz.

        <h2>Charles Mingus</h2>
        <h3>1922 - 1979</h3>
        <div class="artist-info">
          <p>
            Not only one of the best bassists and most creative jazz musicians of all time, Charles Mingus 
            also broke ground with his compositions. Whilst he is mainly remembered for his work as a soloist 
            and bandleader, he did play with some of the greats in his early days, including Charlie Parker, 
            Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington (briefly, until he got fired for fighting…) and Lionel Hampton.
            Such is his legacy, the Mingus Big Band still tours and performs and fans can attend the annual 
            Charles Mingus Festival in New York. With a place in the Grammy Hall of Fame, his legendary album, 
            'Ah-Um' was described by The Penguin Guide to Jazz as “an extended tribute to ancestors”. The 
            Gospel-inspired “Better Get It In Your Soul” features an ecstatic band with the bassist driving 
            a seething gospel hard bop feel. It culminates in a solo by tenor saxophonist Booker Erwin where 
            he plays like a preacher over the clapping of the entire band.

        <h2>Thelonious Monk</h2>
        <h3>1917 - 1982</h3>
        <div class="artist-info">
          <img class="artist-img" src="images/thelonious.jpg" alt="Thelonious Monk">
          <p>
            Monk was instrumental in the birth of bebop, playing in famous jam sessions at Minton's Playhouse 
            with Charlie Christian and Kenny Clarke in the late 1930s, but his sparse, angular playing is 
            very different to the typical bebop piano sound. With a unique, almost childlike approach, critics 
            and jazz club owners initially dismissed this highly eccentric figure, but he has eventually come 
            to be regarded as a jazz genius who was ahead of his time. He is the second most recorded composer 
            in jazz , after Duke Ellington, and his angular tunes have inspired generations of musicians and 
            been the subject of dozens of Monk-themed albums. Quick listening tip: Thelonious Alone in San 
            Francisco Monk's third solo piano album includes originals and standards, and demonstrates that, 
            despite his modernism, his playing was deeply connected to the stride pianists of the 1920s and 1930s.
